			As part of an assignment for Swahili I at the University of Pittsburgh, I decided to create a "cheat sheet" or quick reference for the vocabulary and conjugations that we've covered.  These will mostly be basics for people who forget things like negations, conjugation, etc.
			<br><br>With that in mind, please email me using the sidebar if you find any issues or would like to suggest more content to be added.  Thank you :)
