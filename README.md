Swahili Cheat Sheet is a small project (mainly flat html) that I worked on as part of a course at the University of Pittsburgh.

The website can be found at www.SwahiliCheatSheet.com.

It is a compilation of notes, charts, and other resources to help those learning Swahili.  It was designed mainly as a study aid/refresher course for common grammatical constructs.

Although Google App Engine is a bit overkill, I got tired of free hosting ads and downtime, so I use it as my version of free hosting. :)

As such, I have a small Python backend that templates my HTML/CSS together to generate the single page website.
